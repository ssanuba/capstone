Speaker,Content
CARL,"Quite a sight, huh Ellie? (noticing mailbox) Uhp, mail's here."
CARL,Shady Oaks Retirement.    Oh brother.
CARL,Hm.
CARL,No. Yes. Tell your boss over there that you boys are ruining our house.
CARL,I believe I made my position to your boss quite clear.
CARL,"Oh yeah, that was good. Here, let me talk to him."
CARL,"(in megaphone) You in the suit. Yes, you.      Take a bath, hippy!"
CARL,Tell your boss he can have our house.
CARL,When I'm dead! Carl SLAMS the door.
RUSSELL,"""Good afternoon. My name is Russell. And I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12. Are you in need of any assistance today, sir?"""
CARL,No.
RUSSELL,I could help you cross the street.
CARL,No.
RUSSELL,I could help you cross your yard.
CARL,No.
RUSSELL,I could help you cross your... porch?
CARL,No.
RUSSELL,"Well, I gotta help you cross something."
CARL,"Uh, no.   I'm doing fine."
RUSSELL,"""Good afternoon. My name is Russell."""
CARL,Uh... kid...
RUSSELL,"""And I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12."""
CARL,Kid.   KID!!
RUSSELL,"""Are you in need of any assistance today Sir?"""
CARL,"Thank you, but I don't need any help!"
RUSSELL,Ow.
RUSSELL,"""Good afternoon. My-"""
CARL,But skip to the end!
RUSSELL,"See these? These are my Wilderness Explorer badges. You may notice one is missing. It's my Assisting the Elderly badge. If I get it I will become a Senior Wilderness Explorer! Russell makes the Explorer Sign: his thumbs form a ""W"", his fingers the ""wings"" of a bird, then the ""claws"" of a bear."
RUSSELL,"""The wilderness must be explored!"
RUSSELL,"It's gonna be great! There's a big ceremony, and all the dads come, and they pin on our badges..."
CARL,So you want to assist an old person?
RUSSELL,Yep! Then I will be a Senior Wilderness Explorer! Carl leans in close to Russell.
RUSSELL,Snipe?
CARL,Bird. Beady eyes. Every night it sneaks in my yard and gobbles my poor azaleas. I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it. If only someone could help me...
RUSSELL,Me! Me!   I'll do it!
CARL,"Oh, I don't know, it's awfully crafty. You'd have to clap your hands three times to lure it in."
RUSSELL,"I'll find it, Mr. Fredricksen!"
CARL,I think its burrow is two blocks down. If you go past --
RUSSELL,Two blocks down! Got it!
RUSSELL,Sniiiipe! Here Snipey Snipey...
CARL,(calls after Russell) Bring it back here when you find it! Carl rolls his eyes and begins to close his door.
CARL,What? Hey! Hey you!         What do you think you're doing?
CARL,Don't touch that!
CARL,I don't want you to touch it! Carl HITS the worker with his cane.      He falls to the sidewalk. The worker rubs his head.    Blood.
CARL,"What do I do now, Ellie?"
CARL,Morning gentlemen.
CARL,Ready as I'll ever be. Would you do me a favor and take this?
CARL,I'll meet you at the van in just a minute. I... want to say one last goodbye to the old place.
CARL,So long boys! I'll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls!
CARL,"We're on our way, Ellie. Carl kneels at the fireplace and plunks the balloon strings tied to the grate. He CHUCKLES and settles into his chair.   He closes his eyes and smiles. SHADOWS move gently across the fireplace mantle."
CARL,Huh?
CARL,Hm.
RUSSELL,"Hi, Mr. Fredricksen.    It's me, Russell."
CARL,"What are you doing out here, kid?"
RUSSELL,"I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch, but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse."
RUSSELL,Please let me in?
CARL,No.
CARL,"Oh, alright, you can come... Russell runs into the house past Carl."
CARL,...in.
RUSSELL,Huh. I've never been in a floating house before.
RUSSELL,Goggles.   Look at this stuff! Russell finds Ellie's house drawing sitting on the pages of the open atlas.
RUSSELL,"Wow, you going on a trip? (reads from the engraving) ""Paradise Falls: A Land Lost in Time."" You going to South America, Mr. Fredricksen? Carl takes the page and puts it in his pocket."
CARL,Don't touch that.   You'll soil it.
RUSSELL,"You know, most people take a plane, but you're smart because you'll have all your TV and clocks and stuff. Russell runs over to the steering rig."
RUSSELL,Whoah.   Is this how you steer your house?   Does it really work?
CARL,"Kid, would you stop with the -- Russell steers and the house tilts, knocking Carl back and forth."
RUSSELL,"Oh, this makes it go right, and that way's left."
CARL,Let go of the -- knock it off! Russell looks out the window in front of him.
RUSSELL,"Hey look, buildings!"
RUSSELL,That building's so close I could almost touch it.
RUSSELL,"Wow! This is great! You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen! Look, there's a bus that could take me home two blocks away! (looking up) Hey, I can see your house from here!"
CARL,"(struggling to hold on) Don't jerk around so much, kid!"
CARL,"Well, that's not gonna work."
RUSSELL,"I know that cloud, it's a Cumulo Nimbus. Did you know that the Cumulo Nimbus..."
CARL,"Stayed up all night blowing up balloons, for what?"
RUSSELL,"...warm air goes by cool air, and the airs go by each other and that's how we get lightning."
CARL,"That's nice, kid."
RUSSELL,"(nearly silent) Mr. Fredricksen, there's a big storm coming. It's starting to get scary. We're gonna get blown to bits! We're in big trouble, Mr. Fredricksen!"
CARL,What are you doing over there?
RUSSELL,Look!
RUSSELL,See?    Cumulo Nimbus.
RUSSELL,My pack!
RUSSELL,Got ya!
RUSSELL,Whew!    I thought you were dead.
CARL,Wha... what happened?
RUSSELL,I steered us. I did!      I steered the house!
CARL,Steered us?
RUSSELL,"After you tied your stuff down you took a nap, so I went ahead and steered us down here."
CARL,Huh?
CARL,Can't tell where we are.
RUSSELL,"Oh we're in South America all right. It was a cinch, with my Wilderness Explorer GPS."
CARL,GP-what?
RUSSELL,"My dad gave it to me. It shows exactly where we are on the planet. With this baby, we'll never be lost! Russell gestures, tossing the unit out the window."
RUSSELL,Oops.
CARL,"We'll get you down, find a bus stop. You just tell the man you want to go back to your mother."
RUSSELL,"Sure, but I don't think they have busses in Paradise Falls."
CARL,"There. That ought to do it. Here, I'll give you some change for bus fare."
RUSSELL,"Nah, I'll just use my city bus pass."
RUSSELL,"Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?"
CARL,"Well, we're up pretty high.   Could take hours to get down. Something flashes by them in the fog.   Carl leans forward."
RUSSELL,"What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?"
CARL,We can't be close to the ground yet.
CARL,"Wait, wait! No don't, don't, don't!"
CARL,"Whoah!   Hey, hey! Russell JUMPS onto Carl's leg and the extra weight pulls them to the ground."
CARL,"Russell, hang on! Carl and Russell slide toward the edge of a CLIFF EDGE."
RUSSELL,Whoah! They slide toward the edge... and stop.   The drop is thousands of feet. Carl is TERRIFIED.
CARL,Walk back!     Walk back!
RUSSELL,Okay!
CARL,(out of breath) Where... where are we?
RUSSELL,"This doesn't look like the city or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen. The wind picks up and they STRUGGLE against it."
CARL,"(to house) Don't worry, Ellie. I got it. The wind clears the fog, slowly revealing a crescent shaped, flat-topped mountain on which they stand."
CARL,"There it is. Ellie, it's so beautiful."
CARL,"We made it. We made it! Russell, we could float right over there. Climb up. Climb up!"
RUSSELL,You mean assist you?
CARL,"Yeah, yeah. Whatever."
RUSSELL,"Okay, I'll climb up!"
CARL,Watch it.
RUSSELL,Sorry. The hose jiggles as Russell CLIMBS out of frame.
CARL,"Now, when you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up! Got it?!"
CARL,You on the porch yet?!
CARL,"What? That's it?! I came all this way just to get stuck at the wrong end of this rock pile? Aw, great!"
RUSSELL,"Hey, if I could assist you over there, would you sign off on my badge?"
CARL,What are you talking about?
RUSSELL,We could walk your house to the falls!
CARL,Walk it?
RUSSELL,"Yeah, after all, we weigh it down. We could walk it right over there. Like a parade balloon. Carl considers this."
CARL,"Now, we're gonna walk to the falls quickly and quietly, with no rap music or flash-dancing. Russell inspects his surroundings."
CARL,"We have three days, at best, before the helium leaks out of those balloons. And if we're not at the falls when that happens..."
RUSSELL,Sand!
CARL,...we're not getting to the falls!
RUSSELL,I found sand!
CARL,"Don't you worry, Ellie.    We'll get our house over there. Russell looks up at the house.   Who's Carl talking to?"
RUSSELL,"Huh. (shrugs it off) This is fun already, isn't it? By the time we get there, you're gonna feel so assisted... Oh, Mr. Fredricksen, if we happen to get separated, use the Wilderness Explorer call. Caw caw, raaar!!"
RUSSELL,Wait. Why are we going to Paradise Falls again?
CARL,"Hey, let's play a game. It's called: ""See who can be quiet the longest."""
RUSSELL,Cool!   My mom loves that game!
CARL,"Darn thing. (calling back) C'mon, Russell, would you hurry it up?"
RUSSELL,I'm tiiiired. And my knee hurts.
CARL,Which knee?
RUSSELL,My elbow hurts and I have to go to the bathroom.
CARL,I asked you about that five minutes ago!
RUSSELL,"Well, I didn't have to go then! Russell goes limp and lies face down in the dirt."
RUSSELL,I don't want to walk anymore.     Can we stop?
CARL,"Russell! If you don't hurry up, the tigers will eat you."
RUSSELL,There's no tigers in South America. Russell rolls over to show Carl a badge.
RUSSELL,Zoology.
CARL,"Oh, for the love of Pete. Go on into the bushes and do your business."
RUSSELL,"Okay!   Here, hold my stuff."
RUSSELL,I've always wanted to try this!
CARL,Eugh!   None of my concern! Beat.
RUSSELL,Huh?  Tracks?!
RUSSELL,"Here, snipe... Come on out, snipe. Snipe! The footprints continue for a time, then stop."
RUSSELL,Huh. Russell munches on a chocolate bar.
RUSSELL,Ha! Gotcha!
RUSSELL,"Don't be afraid, little snipe. I am a Wilderness Explorer so I am a friend to all of nature. Want some more?"
RUSSELL,Hi boy.    Don't eat it all.   Come on out.
RUSSELL,Come on. Don't be afraid little snipe. Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice... A massive shadowy creature rises up over Russell.
RUSSELL,...giant snipe!
RUSSELL,I found the snipe!
CARL,"(humoring him) Oh, did you?"
RUSSELL,Are they tall?
CARL,"Oh yes, they're very tall."
RUSSELL,Do they have a lot of colors?
CARL,They do indeed.
RUSSELL,Do they like chocolate?
CARL,Oh ye-   Chocolate?
CARL,What is that thing?!
RUSSELL,It's a snipe!
CARL,There's no such thing as a snipe!
RUSSELL,But you said snipes eat--
RUSSELL,Whoah! Russell GIGGLES.
CARL,"Go on, get out of here. Go on! Shoo!"
CARL,"Careful, Russell!"
CARL,Russell! The bird grooms Russell.
CARL,"Get out of here.    Go on, git!"
CARL,Aaaah!
RUSSELL,"Uh-oh! No no no no no Kevin, it's okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice!"
CARL,"""Kevin""?"
RUSSELL,"Yeah, that's his name I just gave him."
CARL,Hey. Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!
CARL,Hey!   That's mine!
CARL,"Aaah!   Shoo, shoo! Get out of here."
CARL,"Go on, beat it."
RUSSELL,"Can we keep him? Please?? I'll get the food for him, I'll walk him, I'll change his newspapers..."
CARL,No.
CARL,That doesn't even rhyme.
RUSSELL,Yeah it does. Russell points up to the roof of Carl's house.
RUSSELL,"Hey, look!     Kevin!"
CARL,What? Get down! You're not allowed up there!
CARL,You come down here right now!
CARL,"Sheesh!   Can you believe this, Ellie?"
RUSSELL,Ellie? (gets idea)
RUSSELL,"(cont'd) Uh, hey Ellie, could I keep the bird? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (to Carl) She said for you to let me."
CARL,(to Ellie) But I told him no -- (catches himself) I told you no! N-O. The bird HISSES at Carl.
CARL,I see you back there!
CARL,"Go on, get out of here. Shoo! Go annoy someone else for a while."
CARL,"Uh, hello?"
CARL,Oh!   Hello sir!    Thank goodness.
CARL,It's nice to know someone else is up here!
CARL,What?    You can smell us?
CARL,Hey.
RUSSELL,You were talking to a rock. Russell points to another rock shape.
RUSSELL,"Hey, that one looks like a turtle!"
RUSSELL,"Look at that one!     That one looks like a dog! The ""rock"" walks forward."
RUSSELL,It is a dog!
CARL,What?
RUSSELL,"Uh, we're not allowed to have dogs in my apartment. The dog nuzzles Russell, who nervously pets it."
RUSSELL,"Hey, I like dogs!"
CARL,(calls out) We have your dog! (to self) Wonder who he belongs to?
RUSSELL,Sit boy.
RUSSELL,"Hey look, he's trained!    Shake!"
RUSSELL,Uh-huh.    Speak.
CARL,"Did that dog just say ""Hi there?"""
CARL,Uh..wha?
CARL,It's not possible.
RUSSELL,"Cool! What do these do, boy?"
CARL,"Russell, don't touch that. It could be radioactive or something. Dug sniffs the ground around Carl and Russell."
CARL,"Yes! Take it! And on the way, learn how to bark like a real dog!"
RUSSELL,Can we keep him? Please please please?
CARL,No.
RUSSELL,But it's a talking dog!
CARL,It's just a weird trick or something. Let's get to the falls.
RUSSELL,(on video screen) Hey Dug! Who you talking to?
RUSSELL,"Dug, stop bothering Kevin!"
CARL,I am not your master!
RUSSELL,Hey!     Quit it!
CARL,Russell! At this rate we'll never get to the falls!
CARL,"I am nobody's master, got it? (points to bird) I don't want you here, (points to Dug) ...and I don't want you here. (points to Russell) I'm stuck with you. And if you two don't clear out of here by the time I count to three- Dug sees the tennis balls on Carl's cane."
CARL,Ball? Carl pops off one of the tennis balls.
CARL,You want it boy?     Huh?   Huh?   Yeah?
CARL,Go get it!! Carl throws the ball far away.    Dug chases after it.
RUSSELL,Why?
CARL,Just give it to me! Carl grabs some chocolate and waves it at the bird.
CARL,Bird.   Bird! Carl THROWS the chocolate.     The bird runs after it.
CARL,C'mon Russell!
RUSSELL,"Wait.   Wait, Mr. Fredricksen."
CARL,Daah!
CARL,Aaahh...
RUSSELL,What are we doing?
RUSSELL,"Hey, uh, we're pretty far now. Kevin's gonna miss me."
CARL,I think that did the trick.
CARL,Afternoon. Carl turns the other way.       The bird.   It HONKS at him.
CARL,"Well, thanks for keeping us dry anyway, Ellie."
RUSSELL,"Is this step three, or step five? Carl ROLLS HIS EYES at Russell's ineptness."
RUSSELL,"There! Russell struggles with a tent pole, trying to winch it into place."
RUSSELL,"All done. Russell turns, revealing a large RED WELT on his face."
RUSSELL,(pointing to tent) That's for you!
RUSSELL,Awh.   Tents are hard.
CARL,"Wait, aren't you ""Super Wilderness Guy?"" With the GPM's and the badges?"
RUSSELL,"Yeah, but... can I tell you a secret?"
CARL,No.
RUSSELL,"Alright, here goes. I never actually built a tent before. There. I said it."
CARL,"You've been camping before, haven't you?"
RUSSELL,"Well, never outside."
CARL,"Well, why didn't you ask your Dad how to build a tent?"
RUSSELL,I don't think he wants to talk about this stuff.
CARL,Why don't you try him sometime? Maybe he'll surprise you.
RUSSELL,"Well, he's away a lot.   I don't see him much."
CARL,He's got to be home sometime.
RUSSELL,"Well, I called, but Phyllis told me I bug him too much."
CARL,Phyllis? You call your own mother by her first name?
RUSSELL,Phyllis isn't my mom. Carl realizes he put his foot in it.
CARL,Oh.
RUSSELL,"But he promised he'd come to my Explorer ceremony to pin on my Assisting the Elderly badge, so he can show me about tents then, right?"
CARL,"Hey, uh, why don't you get some sleep. Don't want to wake up the traveling flea circus."
RUSSELL,"Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner. We have to protect him!"
RUSSELL,Can Kevin go with us?
CARL,Alright.   He can come.
RUSSELL,Promise you won't leave him?
CARL,Yeah.
RUSSELL,Cross your heart?
CARL,Cross my heart.
CARL,"What have I got myself into, Ellie?"
CARL,Morning Sweetheart.
CARL,We better get moving.
CARL,"Huh. Bird's gone. Maybe Russell won't notice. (calls out) Alright, everybody up!"
RUSSELL,"Where's Kevin? He's wandered off! Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!"
RUSSELL,"Oh, look! There he is."
CARL,"Hey, that's my food!   Get off my roof!"
CARL,What is it doing?
RUSSELL,Her babies! Kevin's a girl? The bird gobbles the food and jumps off the roof.
RUSSELL,"Wait, Kevin's just leaving? But you promised to protect her!"
RUSSELL,"Her babies need her, we gotta make sure they're together."
CARL,Sorry Russell. We've lost enough time already.
RUSSELL,Yeah...
RUSSELL,"This was her favorite chocolate. Because you sent her away, there's more for you. Carl rolls his eyes and SIGHS."
CARL,Huh?
RUSSELL,Kevin?
CARL,"Wait, we're not going with you. We're going to the falls! Gamma and Beta BARK fiercely at Carl."
CARL,Get away from me! Get down!
CARL,Uh... yeah.
CARL,"Wait, are you Charles Muntz?!"
CARL,The Charles Muntz?
CARL,It's really him! (to Russell) That's Charles Muntz!
CARL,Him!
CARL,"I'm Carl Fredricksen. My wife and I, we were your biggest fans!"
RUSSELL,Uh-huh.
CARL,Wow.
CARL,"We're not actually going inside the ""Spirit of Adventure"" itself?!"
CARL,Would I?!?!
CARL,"Wait up, Mr. Muntz!"
CARL,Jiminy Cricket.
CARL,Did you ever! Will you look at that?
CARL,"Oh my gosh, the Giant Somalian Leopard Tortoise!"
RUSSELL,I liked his other voice. Muntz LAUGHS.
RUSSELL,Yes!! Russell is served a hot dog.   His waiter can't resist and eats a bite.
RUSSELL,Hey!
RUSSELL,Hey!
CARL,"Oh my Ellie would have loved all this. You know, it's because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by Paradise Falls."
CARL,You're sure we're not a bother? I'd hate to impose.
RUSSELL,Hey!
CARL,No!
RUSSELL,"Hey, that looks like Kevin!"
RUSSELL,Yeah! That's my new giant bird pet. I trained it to follow us.
RUSSELL,She likes chocolate.
RUSSELL,"Yeah, I gave her some of my chocolate. She goes ga-ga for it."
CARL,But it ran off!      It's gone now.
CARL,"Well! It's been a wonderful evening, but we'd better be going."
CARL,We don't want to take advantage of your hospitality. Come on Russell.
RUSSELL,But we haven't even had dessert yet.
RUSSELL,Kevin? Muntz walks to the window and looks out.          Atop the roof he sees THE BIRD.
CARL,Hurry!
RUSSELL,I am hurrying!
RUSSELL,They're coming!
CARL,Russell!
CARL,Get back!! Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains down! The dogs stop short.
RUSSELL,Help! Help!
CARL,"Gimme your hand! Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can GRAB it and Carl PULLS him back onto the bird. Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time to reach the end of the line -- A CLIFF EDGE.   A river winds 100 feet below."
RUSSELL,Hang on to Kevin!
RUSSELL,No no no! Kevin! Stay down. (to Carl) She's hurt real bad. Can't we help her get home?
CARL,Alright.   But we've got to hurry.
CARL,See anything?
CARL,This is crazy. I finally meet my childhood hero and he's trying to kill us! What a joke.
CARL,"Careful Russell. The house bumps into a tree, jostling the injured BIRD on the porch."
RUSSELL,"You okay, Kevin? Kevin goes back to sleep.    Russell looks at her BANDAGED LEG."
RUSSELL,"You know what, Mr. Fredricksen? The wilderness isn't quite what I expected."
CARL,Yeah?   How so?
RUSSELL,"It's kinda... wild. I mean, it's not how they made it sound in my book."
CARL,"Hmm, get used to that, kid."
RUSSELL,"My dad made it sound so easy. He's really good at camping, and how to make fire from rocks and stuff. He used to come to all my Sweatlodge meetings."
RUSSELL,"And afterwards we'd go get ice cream at Fentons. I always get chocolate and he gets butter- brickle. Then we'd sit on this one curb, right outside, and I'll count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones, and whoever gets the most, wins. I like that curb. He looks up at Carl."
RUSSELL,"That might sound boring, but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most. They walk in silence.   Carl understands."
RUSSELL,"Look, there it is!"
CARL,"Hold on Russell, stand still!"
CARL,Look at that bird go!
CARL,"Wait up, you overgrown chicken!"
RUSSELL,"That's it, go Kevin!      Go find your babies!"
RUSSELL,Run Kevin! Run!
RUSSELL,Oh no!
CARL,"Russell, give me your knife!"
CARL,No!
RUSSELL,No! Carl pulls his house away from the flames.
RUSSELL,Let her go! Stop!
RUSSELL,Kevin! Carl beats out the flames with his jacket.     He extinguishes the flames.
RUSSELL,You gave away Kevin.   You just gave her away.
CARL,This is none of my concern.      I didn't ask for any of this!
CARL,"I am not your master! And if you hadn't a shown up, none of this would have happened! Bad dog! Bad dog!"
CARL,"Now, whether you assist me or not, I am going to Paradise Falls if it kills me."
RUSSELL,"I don't want this anymore. Russell walks away.   He sits on a rock, alone."
CARL,Russell?
CARL,Russell!
RUSSELL,I'm gonna help Kevin even if you won't!
CARL,"No, Russell! No! Carl runs back to his house and tries in desperation to lift it. He struggles, but the house doesn't budge. The balloons have lost too much helium."
CARL,Wahhoo!
CARL,Russell?
CARL,Dug!
CARL,"Can you stay? Well, you're my dog aren't you? And I'm your master!"
RUSSELL,Ooph!
RUSSELL,Yes!    Don't worry Kevin! I'll save - Growling dogs move toward him.
RUSSELL,Let me go!
RUSSELL,He's not my friend anymore.
RUSSELL,Where are you keeping Kevin!?
RUSSELL,Let me go!
RUSSELL,I'll unleash all my Wilderness Explorer training!
RUSSELL,"Hey, where are you going?    I'm not finished with you!"
CARL,Russell! Carl steers his house to the dirigible.
RUSSELL,Mr. Fredricksen!
CARL,"Dug!   Bring `er over! Dug winches in the hose caddy, pulling the house closer to the dirigible ramp."
RUSSELL,You came back for Kevin!     Let's go get her.
CARL,I'm getting Kevin.    You stay here!
RUSSELL,But I want to help!
CARL,I don't want your help.     I want you safe! Carl leaps back into the dirigible.    Dug follows.
CARL,How do we get past these dogs?
CARL,Kevin!
CARL,"Don't worry Kevin, we're on our way! Alpha enters, leading a group of dogs. Carl and Dug duck into the shadows and watch unnoticed from above."
CARL,Who wants the ball?
CARL,Then go get it! Carl throws the ball.    The dogs scramble after it.
CARL,I'm sorry Kevin.      Let's get you out of here.
RUSSELL,I want to help! He manages to get his arms free.
RUSSELL,Ha ha!
RUSSELL,Whoooaaah!
CARL,"Come on, Kevin."
CARL,Come on!
CARL,"Come on, Kevin!"
RUSSELL,(out of breath) I can't do it!
CARL,(far in the distance) Russell!
RUSSELL,Huh?
RUSSELL,You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!
RUSSELL,Hey! (pointing down) Squirrel!
CARL,"Dug! Dug jumps up on Carl, licking his face."
CARL,Russell!! Over here!!    Let's go!
RUSSELL,Mr. Fredricksen!
CARL,"Come on, Kevin! Carl helps Dug onto the porch.   He climbs up himself..."
CARL,No!
CARL,"Russell!   Get out of there! Russell, Dug and Kevin run toward the front porch."
CARL,No!    Leave them alone!
CARL,Russell! Hang on to Kevin! Don't let go of her!
CARL,Kevin!   Chocolate!
RUSSELL,"That was cool! Russell and Dug dangle from it, sitting on Kevin.     The bird holds on to the hose with her beak. Carl LAUGHS, relieved."
CARL,"Don't jerk around so much, kid! Russell climbs up, followed by the bird and Dug."
RUSSELL,"Sorry about your house, Mr. Fredricksen."
CARL,"You know, it's just a house. Carl, Russell, Dug and Kevin stand on the tail of the airship floating off over the clouds."
CARL,Ow! Ow! Ow!
RUSSELL,Look at you. You're so soft.
RUSSELL,I wish I could keep one.
CARL,"Huh, where's my cane?      I just had it here... Kevin starts HACKING.    She COUGHS up the cane."
CARL,You know what? Keep `em.       A little gift from me to you. The bird family enters the labyrinth.     Carl and Russell wave.
RUSSELL,Bye Kevin! The bird looks back toward Carl and Russell and CALLS OUT one last time before disappearing into the mist.
RUSSELL,Ready? Carl gives a thumbs up.
CARL,Ready!
CARL,(to Camp Master) I'm here for him.
CARL,"Russell, for assisting the elderly, and for performing above and beyond the call of duty, I would like to award you the highest honor I can bestow: The Ellie Badge."
RUSSELL,Wow.
RUSSELL,Blue one.
CARL,Red one.
CARL,Red one.
RUSSELL,That's a bike!
CARL,"It's red, isn't it?"
RUSSELL,"Mr. Fredricksen, you're cheating."
CARL,"No, I'm not. Red one."
RUSSELL,That's a fire hydrant.
CARL,Maybe I need new glasses.
